# 🧠 Skin Cancer Dataset Analysis using SQL

## 📄 Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of a **Skin Cancer Dataset** containing **1,088 records**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding how demographic factors, lesion characteristics, and lifestyle habits relate to different types of skin cancer.  
All exploration and insights were derived using **SQL queries** to uncover meaningful patterns in the data.

---

## 🧬 Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information about:
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, skin tone (Fitzpatrick scale)
- **Lesion Characteristics:** Type, color change, elevation, pain, itching, bleeding
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to pesticides, piped water
- **Cancer Type Classification:**  
  - *Malignant:* Melanoma, SCC, BCC  
  - *Benign:* Nevus (NEV), Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK)  
  - *Precancerous:* Actinic Keratosis (ACK)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The key goals of this analysis were to:
1. Examine the distribution of skin cancer across **age groups** and **skin tones**.  
2. Identify the **most affected body regions**.  
3. Compare **lesion behavior patterns** across cancer types.  
4. Assess **environmental and lifestyle risk factors** such as smoking and alcohol use.  
5. Highlight actionable public health strategies based on findings.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**
- **Excel / CSV** for dataset management
- **PowerPoint** for presentation reporting

---

## 📊 Analysis Summary
- **Total Records:** 1,088  
- **Gender Split:** 726 males, 362 females  
- **Age Range:** 6 – 94 years  
- **Most Commonly Affected Areas:** Face, forearms, chest, back, arms  
- **Dominant Cancer Type:** Actinic Keratosis (ACK) — a precancerous lesion  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Demographic Patterns
- Skin cancer risk **increases with age**.  
- Individuals with **fairer skin tones (Fitzpatrick 0–2)** showed significantly higher risk.

### Lesion Characteristics
- **Melanoma:** Growth + color change (no itch/pain/bleeding).  
- **SCC:** Growth + itching + elevation.  
- **BCC:** Growth + itching + bleeding + elevation.  
- **ACK:** Dominant and marked by persistent itching.

### Lifestyle & Environmental Factors
- **Smoking:** 62 smokers; 47 had malignant cancers.  
- **Alcohol:** 138 drinkers; 98 had malignant cancers.  
- **Pesticides & Piped Water:** No significant correlation found.

---

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations
1. **Public Awareness:** Educate communities that ACK is a *precancerous condition* requiring attention.  
2. **Screening Programs:** Focus on high-risk groups—fair-skinned, elderly, and outdoor workers.  
3. **Sun Protection:** Encourage sunscreen use, hats, and protective clothing.  
4. **Medical Training:** Train healthcare providers for early ACK detection and referral.  
5. **Policy Development:** Governments and NGOs should integrate ACK management into cancer prevention programs.

## 🧾 Conclusion
The SQL analysis revealed that:
- Age and skin tone are strong determinants of skin cancer risk.  
- Actinic Keratosis (ACK) is the **most dominant and preventable precursor** to malignant skin cancer.  
- Early detection, awareness, and lifestyle changes are key to reducing incidence.  

This project demonstrates how structured **SQL-based analysis** can provide valuable insights for **public health decision-making** and **preventive strategies**.
